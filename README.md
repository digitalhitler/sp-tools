# sp-tools
Current version: `0.9.0`

## WTF?
This is one more JS framework. 

## Why?
Because I can that's why.

In real life this is used by one or few more persons, undocumented, ungaruanteed, buggy, silly etc. 

**DO NOT TRY TO USE IT. NEVER.**

## How?

### Install

```bash
npm install sp-tools
```

### Usage

```javascript
const SP = require('sp-tools');
```

You can globalize it to `global.SP` or `window.SP` (detects automatically) with:

```javascript
SP.Globalize();
```
